# Flutter Mobile Landing Page Implementation

## Overview
This implementation translates the Angular mobile get-started component into a Flutter equivalent, maintaining the same UI/UX design and functionality while adapting it for Flutter's mobile-first approach.

## Key Components Created

### 1. Pet Model (`lib/models/pet_model.dart`)
- Comprehensive model matching the Angular PetModel
- Includes factory methods for Firestore data conversion
- Helper methods for display formatting
- Null-safe implementation with optional fields

### 2. Pets Service (`lib/services/pets_service.dart`)
- Firebase Firestore integration for pet data
- Featured pets functionality
- Search and filtering capabilities
- Favorites management
- Analytics logging (matching Angular implementation)
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms

### 3. Mobile Landing Page (`lib/screens/mobile_landing_page.dart`)
- **Hero Section**: Auto-rotating carousel with touch gestures
- **Value Proposition**: Grid layout showing app benefits
- **Pet Showcase**: Horizontal scroll of featured pets
- **How It Works**: Step-by-step process explanation
- **Call-to-Action**: Footer section encouraging adoption

### 4. Updated Home Screen (`lib/screens/home_screen.dart`)
- Authentication state management
- Conditional rendering (landing page vs dashboard)
- Firebase Auth integration
